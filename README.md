# DSA-C
A set of problems and solutions from my end to Data structures and algorithms in C

# Note
For lazy people like me, I have written a program in python `batch_compiler.py` which will take the directory of your C files as input and you can choose to either compile all of them at once or compile a specific file.
No additional dependencies are needed for the python file to run, it just requires python to be installed.
Also this program will detect the presence of gcc at runtime, and if gcc is not installed, it will notify as such and then, exit.
